## ✨ Project Overview
This project turns a **complete song lyric** (*"I Say a Little Prayer"* by Dionne Warwick) into **dynamic PHP code**.  
It demonstrates how PHP can use **variables, arrays, operators, and type juggling** to build content — not just display it.

## 💻 Key Features
- 🎤 Full song lyrics divided into **verses, chorus, post-chorus, and outro**  
- 📝 Use of **variables** to avoid repeated words (`$nounPrayer = "prayer"`)  
- ➕ **Operators** for arithmetic and string concatenation  
- 🔄 **Type juggling examples**:  
  - `1 + "1"` → converts string to integer  
  - `2 * "1.5"` → converts string to float  
- 💌 Dynamic **mood message** based on verse calculations  
- 🎨 **Clean, centered soft-pink design** with minimal internal CSS
